**POST** `/api/match/talent`


#### Request:

```json
{
  "specsheet": "**Chatbot Project Specification Document**\n==============================================\n\n### Executive Summary\n-------------------\n\n**Project Title:** Chatbot\n**Project Description:** Develop a text-based chatbot with user authentication, data storage, and task management capabilities.\n**Estimated Effort:** N/A person-months (based on COCOMO-II results)\n**Development Time:** N/A months (based on COCOMO-II results)\n**Deliverables:** Functional chatbot system with user authentication, data storage, and task management\n**Key Metrics:**\n\n* Estimated SLOC: N/A\n* Equivalent SLOC (with reuse): N/A\n* Total SLOC (with REVL): N/A\n\n### Project Overview\n------------------\n\n**Project Objectives:**\n\n* Develop a basic chatbot system with user authentication and data storage capabilities\n* Implement a text-based input/output interface for user interaction\n* Create a simple task management system with task creation and deletion features\n\n**Scope:**\n\n* The chatbot system will be built using a standard technology stack (see Technical Architecture section)\n* The system will support basic user authentication, data storage, and task management capabilities\n* The system will be deployed in a cloud-based environment\n\n### Functional Requirements\n-------------------------\n\n#### User Authentication\n\n* The system will have a user authentication module that allows users to register, login, and logout\n* Users will be able to create and manage their own accounts\n* Authentication will be based on username and password\n\n#### Basic Data Storage\n\n* The system will have a data storage module that stores user information and task data\n* Data will be stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS)\n* The system will have a schema to manage data relationships and constraints\n\n#### Text-Based Input/Output\n\n* The system will have a text-based input/output interface for user interaction\n* Users will be able to interact with the system using simple text commands\n* The system will display text-based output to users in response to their input\n\n#### Chatbot Interface\n\n* The system will have a chatbot interface that displays chatbot messages to users\n* Users will be able to interact with the chatbot using simple text commands\n* The chatbot will respond to user input using pre-defined responses\n\n#### Simple Task Management\n\n* The system will have a task management module that allows users to create and delete tasks\n* Users will be able to view and manage their own tasks\n* Tasks will be stored in the database and displayed to users in a list format\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements\n------------------------------\n\n#### Performance\n\n* The system should respond to user input within 2 seconds\n* The system should handle up to 100 concurrent users\n\n#### Security\n\n* The system will use encryption to protect user data in transit and at rest\n* The system will validate user input to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks\n\n#### Scalability\n\n* The system will be designed to scale horizontally using cloud-based infrastructure\n* The system will use load balancing to distribute incoming traffic\n\n### Technical Architecture\n-------------------------\n\n**Technology Stack:**\n\n* Frontend: Node.js with Express.js framework\n* Backend: Node.js with Express.js framework\n* Database: Relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL\n* Cloud Infrastructure: Cloud-based infrastructure such as AWS\n\n**System Design:**\n\n* The system will be designed as a microservices architecture with separate services for authentication, data storage, and task management\n* Each service will be implemented as a Node.js application with its own database schema\n* The services will communicate with each other using RESTful APIs\n\n### Development Estimation\n-------------------------\n\n**COCOMO-II Results:**\n\n* Estimated SLOC: N/A\n* Equivalent SLOC (with reuse): N/A\n* Total SLOC (with REVL): N/A\n* Estimated Effort: N/A person-months\n* Development Time: N/A months\n\n**Timeline Breakdown:**\n\n* Week 1-2: Project planning and preparation\n* Week 3-6: Feature development\n* Week 7-8: Testing and debugging\n* Week 9: Deployment and testing\n\n### Risk Assessment\n-----------------\n\n**Potential Challenges:**\n\n* Technical complexity of implementing user authentication and data storage modules\n* Difficulty in achieving performance and scalability requirements\n\n**Mitigation Strategies:**\n\n* Collaborate with experienced engineers for guidance and support\n* Use established open-source libraries and frameworks for user authentication and data storage modules\n* Monitor performance and scalability metrics to identify areas for improvement\n\n### Deliverables & Milestones\n---------------------------\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\n* Functional chatbot system with user authentication, data storage, and task management capabilities\n* Source code and documentation for each component of the system\n* Test cases and test results for each component of the system\n\n**Milestones:**\n\n* Week 1: Project planning and preparation\n* Week 3: User authentication module complete\n* Week 5: Task management module complete\n* Week 8: Testing and debugging complete\n* Week 9: Deployment and testing complete\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n----------------------\n\n**Success Metrics:**\n\n* The system will have a user authentication module that allows users to register, login, and logout successfully\n* The system will have a data storage module that stores user information and task data successfully\n* The system will have a task management module that allows users to create and delete tasks successfully\n* The system will respond to user input within 2 seconds\n* The system will handle up to 100 concurrent users successfully\n\n### Resource Requirements\n-------------------------\n\n**Team Structure:**\n\n* Project manager\n* Technical lead\n* 3-4 developers with expertise in Node.js, Express.js, and RDBMS\n* QA engineer\n* DevOps engineer\n\n**Skills:**\n\n* Node.js\n* Express.js\n* RDBMS\n* Microservices architecture\n* Cloud-based infrastructure\n* Testing and debugging\n* DevOps\n* Agile project management"
